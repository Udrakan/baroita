  All skill gains are multiplied when playing a single round (i.e. any other game mode than campaign) 
  
SkillIncreasePerRepair:
  Skill gained for repairing a device. Divided by the character's current skill, 
  so a character with a skill level 10 will be able to increase the skill twice as fast as a lvl 20 character.
  
SkillIncreasePerSabotage:
  Skill gained for sabotaging a device as a traitor. Works the same as SkillIncreasePerRepair.
  
SkillIncreasePerCprRevive:
  Skill gained when reviving someone with CPR. 
  
SkillIncreasePerRepairedStructureDamage:
  Skill gained per amount of repaired structure damage. Divided by the character's current skill.
  
SkillIncreasePerSecondWhenSteering:
  Skill gained per second when operating a nav terminal. Divided by the character's current skill.
  
SkillIncreasePerFabricatorRequiredSkill:
  Skill gained when fabricating an item. Multiplied by the skill requirements of fabricating the item,
  and divided by the character's current skill. For example, if fabricating an item requires a mechanical skill of 50,
  this value is set to 1, and a character with a mechanical skill of 25 fabricates the item, their skill increases by 1 * 25 / 50 = 0.5.
